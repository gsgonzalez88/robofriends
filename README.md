This project was bootstrapped with Create React App
I added Redux to manage the state

## Robofriends

A simple web app that display robot cards with basic contact information.

### `API`

I used an API called jsonplaceholder to get the users with all the information for each one,
then i used robohash to obtain randomly images for my robot cards.


**Note: this was all part of a proyect for learning how to use REDUX with REACT. **

I hope you enjoy it!
